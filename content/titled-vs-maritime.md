# Titled vs Maritime Concession Properties

In Costa Rica, property ownership can be categorized into titled properties and maritime concessions.

## Titled Properties
Titled properties have full ownership rights recorded in the public registry. They offer security and ease of transfer.

## Maritime Concessions
Maritime concessions are granted by the government for properties within 200 meters of the high tide line. They have specific restrictions and renewal requirements.

## Key Differences
- **Ownership**: Titled is private; Maritime is government concession.
- **Transfer**: Titled is straightforward; Maritime requires government approval.
- **Usage**: Both can be used for residential/commercial, but maritime has environmental restrictions.
