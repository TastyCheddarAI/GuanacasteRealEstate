## Registry Anatomy
- **Folio Real:** Unique ID linking owner, area, property history, mortgages, liens, annotations.
- **Plano Linkage:** Folio must correspond to an official survey (plano) filed at Catastro.

## Verification Steps
1) Pull literal extract; confirm matching owner ID and property description.
2) Run lien/annotation search; investigate any hipoteca, embargo, or affectations.
3) Cross-check the plano against site conditions and neighboring surveys; resolve overlaps or encroachments before closing.

## Practical Risks
- Old subdivisions with inconsistent measurements; resolve with updated surveys.
- Unrecorded servidumbres used in practice; regularize by notarial act and registration.

## Post-Closing
- Confirm inscription (asiento registral) after deed submission; track registry feedback and fix observations if any.
