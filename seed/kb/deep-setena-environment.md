## Triggers
- New builds, significant renovations, projects near protected areas, wetlands, rivers, or coastal buffers.

## Process
- Initial screening (D1) → SETENA criteria → Full EIA for sensitive cases.
- Technical studies: hydrology, geotechnical, biodiversity as requested.

## Timeline & Risk
- Build buffers into contracts; avoid starting works ahead of approvals.
