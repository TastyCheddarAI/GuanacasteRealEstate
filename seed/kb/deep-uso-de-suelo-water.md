## Uso de Suelo
- Municipality confirms permitted use, density, heights, and parking norms for the parcel.
- Request a fresh certificate whenever zoning plans update.

## Water Letters
- AyA or local ASADA issues: shows capacity and commitment to provide service/meter.
- New meters/line extensions require lead times; include as a closing condition.

## Practical
- Without these letters, designs are speculative; lenders and notaries will require them for risk control.
