- First 200m from the mean high-tide line is the Maritime Zone.
- 0–50m: Public Use Zone (no private construction).
- 50–200m: Restricted Zone; municipalities may grant concessions (use-rights) for defined terms (commonly 5–20 years).
- Concessions require adherence to a Plan Regulador Costero (coastal zoning plan) and municipal approvals.
- Concessions are not fee-simple ownership; foreigners are subject to shareholding limits in concession-holding entities.
