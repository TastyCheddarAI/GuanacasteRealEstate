## ZMT Basics
- **0–50m Public Zone:** No private occupation or construction.
- **50–200m Restricted Zone:** Use rights by municipal concession; not fee simple ownership.

## Concession Diligence
- Confirm concession **contract**, **term**, **canon** (fees), **plan regulador** alignment, and **use category** (residential/commercial/tourism).
- Verify payments are current; check for infractions or revocation risks.
- Confirm shareholder/residency rules for concession-holding entities; foreign participation limits can apply (verify locally).

## Transfer Considerations
- Concession rights generally transfer per municipal rules; assignments need municipal approval.
- Development requires environmental permits and coastal design compliance.

## Risk Controls
- Condition the deal on municipal certifications; keep timeline buffer.
- Avoid assumptions about renewals; assess performance against contract conditions.
