## Overview
Surf-centric string of beaches south of Tamarindo with less density and more tranquility. Road surfaces vary; growth is steady but curated.

## Real Estate Texture
- **Product Mix:** Eco villas, surf lodges, small-scale condo enclaves, raw land.
- **Investment Lens:** Lower buy-in than Tamarindo core; ADRs tied to surf proximity.

## Infrastructure & Services
- **Access:** Mixed paved/gravel; seasonal maintenance affects travel times.
- **Water:** Mixed ASADAs; letters before design.
- **Power/Fiber:** Confirm per barrio; backup power recommended.

## Zoning & Compliance
- **Coastal:** ZMT diligence for near-shore parcels; inland titled common.
- **Environmental:** Mangrove/river setbacks; request hydrology for low-lying lots.

## Buyer Notes
- Expect longer utility lead times; build contingencies into contracts.

## Lifestyle Snapshot
Surf first; slower pace; boutique food scene; strong expat micro-communities.
