## Overview
Two picturesque bays; family-friendly waters and calmer vibe than northern hubs. Balanced mix of expats and locals.

## Real Estate Texture
- **Product Mix:** Beach-adjacent homes (some ZMT), hillside ocean-views, in-town mixed use, small hotels.
- **Investment Lens:** Stable ADR for families; seasonality less extreme due to protected bays.

## Infrastructure & Services
- **Access:** Paved approach via Nicoya; 2–2.5 hrs from LIR.
- **Water:** ASADA networks; confirm capacity for expansions.
- **Healthcare/Schools:** Local clinics; bilingual schools in region.

## Zoning & Compliance
- **Coastal:** Concession diligence near beaches; inland titled more straightforward.
- **Municipal:** Nicoya oversight; check Uso de Suelo and septic specs.

## Buyer Notes
- Drainage/septic near bays demand careful design; stormwater planning critical.

## Lifestyle Snapshot
Laid-back beach town living; kayaking, paddleboarding, family dining.
