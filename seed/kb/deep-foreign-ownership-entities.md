## Ownership Options
- Direct personal title or via Costa Rican entity (S.A. or S.R.L.).
- Consider estate planning, liability, and banking when choosing structure.

## Concessions Caveat
- Coastal concessions may impose foreign participation/residency limits; verify municipal rules before structuring.

## Residency via Investment
- Property investment can be part of an investor residency route subject to national thresholds; consult immigration counsel.

## Practical Setup
- Obtain a CR tax ID (NITE/Dimex as applicable), open local bank accounts, and document utility/tax payments in owner or entity name.
