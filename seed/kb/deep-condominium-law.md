## Structure
- Condominium regime recorded at Registry with bylaws and master plano; units have % participation in common areas.

## Buyer Diligence
- Review CCRs/bylaws: STR rules, pet policies, architectural controls.
- Financials: operating budgets, reserves, arrears list, special assessments history.
- Insurance: building policy scope; owner gap coverage.

## Transaction Notes
- Verify parking/storage allocations in registry description.
- Renovations may need HOA architectural approval and municipal permits.

## Practical
- Expect professional PM in larger resorts; small HOAs vary in governance quality.
