## Overview
Playa Grande borders the Tamarindo estuary and lies within the Las Baulas National Park buffer. Conservation rules shape development. It's quieter than Tamarindo and prized for surf and low-key lodging.

## Real Estate Texture
- **Product Mix:** Eco-lodges, low-density villas, selective boutique condo projects.
- **Investment Lens:** Premium for proximity to surf and preserved environment; supply constrained by rules.

## Infrastructure & Services
- **Access:** Road via Matapalo/Huacas; estuary ferry crossings to Tamarindo are limited.
- **Water:** Verify availability letters early; smaller ASADAs serve pockets.
- **Utilities:** Check power reliability and fiber availability per enclave.

## Zoning & Compliance
- **Environmental Buffer:** National Park adjacency limits heights/density; EIA (SETENA) often required.
- **Coastal Rules:** Parcels within ZMT require concession and adherence to Plan Regulador Costero if applicable.

## Buyer Notes
- Confirm property location vs protected zones on official maps.
- Expect longer permitting lead times; engage a local architect experienced with park buffer requirements.

## Lifestyle Snapshot
Serene surf village vibe; fewer restaurants; wildlife corridors; night skies remain dark by design.
